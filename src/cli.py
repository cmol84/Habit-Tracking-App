"""
    Command-Line Interface (CLI) function.

    This function is the entry point for a command-line interface application.

    However, as it stands, the function has no implementation inside the function body, and thus,
    it does not perform any actions or execute any commands when called. Developers typically
    extend the functionality of this function to handle command-line arguments,
    execute various tasks, and interact with users through the terminal.
    Note: Without any implementation, this function does not produce any output or
    perform any actions when executed.
